            <h2>Our Efforts</h2>
            <p>We work to raise awareness about the impact of deforestation in
                Indonesia and to promote sustainable forest management
                practices. We also support reforestation efforts and work to

        <section class="deforestation">
            <h2>Deforestation</h2>
            <p>Due to continual population growth, forests are often cut down to
                make space for farms and pastures. By cutting forests down,
                carbon emissions are released into the environment, further
                contributing to global warming. While this initial release of
                carbon is slightly harmful to the environment, deforestation
                presents major issues in the loss of a carbon sink, soil
                erosion, and loss of biodiversity. From 1990-2020, Indonesia had
                a large change in forest area and even lost over 100,000 square
                miles. This reflects major deforestation in Indonesia and
                manifests the growing concern of climate change by reducing the
                world’s natural carbon sink, losing and eroding soil, and
                contributing to a loss in biodiversity.</p>

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
            <div class="solution">
                <h3>Promoting Sustainability and Regrowth of Forests</h3>
                <p>A possible solution towards solving deforestation in Indonesia is by promoting the sustainability and regrowth of forests. Since Indonesia has a major lumber industry, with it’s value reaching over 12 billion USD, completely stopping deforestation would be inconceivable. However, the current rate of deforestation in Indonesia presents worries for growing climate change. Thus, organizations like Team Trees or movements that promote sustainability education and work to establish tree nurseries or the planting of new trees. This solution would influence communities through means like social media and would take root in social groups throughout Indonesia by inspiring individuals to take part in restoring the forestry in Indonesia.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="solution">
                <h3>Foreign Investment in Export Area Shift</h3>
                <p>As deforestation is a global problem, one solution would be to allow for foreign entities (from both private and public/governmental) to easily invest in an export area shift within Indonesia. Governments around the world can also support low interest loans for Indonesia, which would help speed up the shift in Indonesia’s export focus from deforestation to other technologies. Indonesia is also a country with one of the highest technological advancements in the 21st century, with a sizable population to sustain the growth, so it will be of the investor’s interest to invest in Indonesian growth away from deforestation.</p>
